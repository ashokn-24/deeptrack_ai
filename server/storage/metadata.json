For the Microsoft technology, see COM Structured Storage.\nNoSQL (originally meaning \"Not only SQL\" or \"non-relational\")[1] refers to a type of database design that stores and retrieves data differently from the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which organize data into rows and columns like a spreadsheet, NoSQL databases use a single data structure\u2014such as key\u2013value pairs, wide columns, graphs, or documents\u2014to hold information. Since this non-relational design does not require a fixed schema, it scales easily to manage large, often unstructured datasets.[2] NoSQL systems are sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" because they can support SQL-like query languages or work alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent setups, where multiple database types are combined.[3][4] Non-relational databases date back to the late 1960s, but the term \"NoSQL\" emerged in the early 2000s, spurred by the needs of Web 2.0 companies like social media platforms.[5][6]\nNoSQL databases are popular in big data and real-time web applications due to their simple design, ability to scale across clusters of machines (called horizontal scaling), and precise control over data availability.[7][8] These structures can speed up certain tasks and are often considered more adaptable than fixed database tables.[9] However, many NoSQL systems prioritize speed and availability over strict consistency (per the CAP theorem), using eventual consistency\u2014where updates reach all nodes eventually, typically within milliseconds, but may cause brief delays in accessing the latest data, known as stale reads.[10] While most lack full ACID transaction support, some, like MongoDB, include it as a key feature.[11]\n\n\nBarriers to adoption[edit]\nBarriers to wider NoSQL adoption include their use of low-level query languages instead of SQL, inability to perform ad hoc joins across tables, lack of standardized interfaces, and significant investments already made in relational databases.[12] Some NoSQL systems risk losing data through lost writes or other forms, though features like write-ahead logging\u2014a method to record changes before they\u2019re applied\u2014can help prevent this.[13][14] For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, keeping data consistent is a challenge for both NoSQL and relational systems, as relational databases cannot enforce rules linking separate databases, and few systems support both ACID transactions and X/Open XA standards for managing distributed updates.[15][16] Limitations within the interface environment are overcome using semantic virtualization protocols, such that NoSQL services are accessible to most operating systems.[17]\n\n\nThe term NoSQL was used by Carlo Strozzi in 1998 to name his lightweight Strozzi NoSQL open-source relational database that did not expose the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) interface, but was still relational.[18] His NoSQL RDBMS is distinct from the around-2009 general concept of NoSQL databases.  Strozzi suggests that, because the current NoSQL movement \"departs from the relational model altogether, it should therefore have been called more appropriately 'NoREL'\",[19] referring to \"not relational\".\nJohan Oskarsson, then a developer at Last.fm, reintroduced the term NoSQL in early 2009 when he organized an event to discuss \"open-source distributed, non-relational databases\".[20] The name attempted to label the emergence of an increasing number of non-relational, distributed data stores, including open source clones of Google's Bigtable/MapReduce and Amazon's DynamoDB.\n\n\nThere are various ways to classify NoSQL databases, with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap.

In this model, data is represented as a collection of key\u2013value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.[24][25]\nThe key\u2013value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and richer data models are often implemented as an extension of it. The key\u2013value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that maintains keys in lexicographic order. This extension is computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective key ranges.[26]\nKey\u2013value stores can use consistency models ranging from eventual consistency to serializability. Some databases support ordering of keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users store data in memory (RAM), while others on solid-state drives (SSD) or rotating disks (aka hard disk drive (HDD)).\n\n\n\nThe central concept of a document store is that of a \"document\". While the details of this definition differ among document-oriented databases, they all assume that documents encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard formats or encodings. Encodings in use include XML, YAML, and JSON and binary forms like BSON. Documents are addressed in the database via a unique key that represents that document.

Performance evaluation must pay attention to the right benchmarks such as production configurations, parameters of the databases, anticipated data volume, and concurrent user workloads.\nBen Scofield rated different categories of NoSQL databases as follows:[28]\n\n\n\nData model\nPerformance\nScalability\nFlexibility\nComplexity\nData integrity\nFunctionality\n\n\nKey\u2013value store\nhigh\nhigh\nhigh\nnone\nlow\nvariable (none)\n\n\nColumn-oriented store\nhigh\nhigh\nmoderate\nlow\nlow\nminimal\n\n\nDocument-oriented store\nhigh\nvariable (high)\nhigh\nlow\nlow\nvariable (low)\n\n\nGraph database\nvariable\nvariable\nhigh\nhigh\nlow-med\ngraph theory\n\n\nRelational database\nvariable\nvariable\nlow\nmoderate\nhigh\nrelational algebra\n\nPerformance and scalability comparisons are most commonly done using the YCSB benchmark.\n\nHandling relational data[edit]\nSince most NoSQL databases lack ability for joins in queries, the database schema generally needs to be designed differently. There are three main techniques for handling relational data in a NoSQL database. (See table join and ACID support for NoSQL databases that support joins.)\n\n\nInstead of retrieving all the data with one query, it is common to do several queries to get the desired data. NoSQL queries are often faster than traditional SQL queries, so the cost of additional queries may be acceptable. If an excessive number of queries would be necessary, one of the other two approaches is more appropriate.\n\nCaching, replication and non-normalized data[edit]\nInstead of only storing foreign keys, it is common to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each blog comment might include the username in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes, however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.[29]\n\n\nWith document databases like MongoDB it is common to put more data in a smaller number of collections. For example, in a blogging application, one might choose to store comments within the blog post document, so that with a single retrieval one gets all the comments. Thus in this approach a single document contains all the data needed for a specific task.\n\nACID and join support[edit]\nA database is marked as supporting ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) or join operations if the documentation for the database makes that claim. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the capability is fully supported in a manner similar to most SQL databases.\n\n\n\nDatabase\nACID\nJoins\n\n\nAerospike\nYes\nNo\n\n\nAgensGraph\nYes\nYes\n\n\nApache Ignite\nYes\nYes\n\n\nArangoDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nAmazon DynamoDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCouchbase\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCouchDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nIBM Db2\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInfinityDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nLMDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nMarkLogic\nYes\nYes[nb 1]\n\n\nMongoDB\nYes\nYes[nb 2]\n\n\nOrientDB\nYes\nYes[nb 3]\n\n\n^ Joins do not necessarily apply to document databases, but MarkLogic can do joins using semantics.[30]\n\n^ MongoDB did not support joining from a sharded collection until version 5.1.[31]\n\n^ OrientDB can resolve 1:1 joins using links by storing direct links to foreign records.[32]\n\n\nQuery optimization and indexing in NoSQL databases[edit]\nDifferent NoSQL databases, such as DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase, and Redis, exhibit varying behaviors when querying non-indexed fields. Many perform full-table or collection scans for such queries, applying filtering operations after retrieving data. However, modern NoSQL databases often incorporate advanced features to optimize query performance. For example, MongoDB supports compound indexes and query-optimization strategies, Cassandra offers secondary indexes and materialized views, and Redis employs custom indexing mechanisms tailored to specific use cases. Systems like Elasticsearch use inverted indexes for efficient text-based searches, but they can still require full scans for non-indexed fields. This behavior reflects the design focus of many NoSQL systems on scalability and efficient key-based operations rather than optimized querying for arbitrary fields. Consequently, while these databases excel at basic CRUD operations and key-based lookups, their suitability for complex queries involving joins or non-indexed filtering varies depending on the database type\u2014document, key\u2013value, wide-column, or graph\u2014and the specific implementation.

Performance evaluation must pay attention to the right benchmarks such as production configurations, parameters of the databases, anticipated data volume, and concurrent user workloads.\nBen Scofield rated different categories of NoSQL databases as follows:[28]\n\n\n\nData model\nPerformance\nScalability\nFlexibility\nComplexity\nData integrity\nFunctionality\n\n\nKey\u2013value store\nhigh\nhigh\nhigh\nnone\nlow\nvariable (none)\n\n\nColumn-oriented store\nhigh\nhigh\nmoderate\nlow\nlow\nminimal\n\n\nDocument-oriented store\nhigh\nvariable (high)\nhigh\nlow\nlow\nvariable (low)\n\n\nGraph database\nvariable\nvariable\nhigh\nhigh\nlow-med\ngraph theory\n\n\nRelational database\nvariable\nvariable\nlow\nmoderate\nhigh\nrelational algebra\n\nPerformance and scalability comparisons are most commonly done using the YCSB benchmark.\n\nHandling relational data[edit]\nSince most NoSQL databases lack ability for joins in queries, the database schema generally needs to be designed differently. There are three main techniques for handling relational data in a NoSQL database. (See table join and ACID support for NoSQL databases that support joins.)\n\n\nInstead of retrieving all the data with one query, it is common to do several queries to get the desired data. NoSQL queries are often faster than traditional SQL queries, so the cost of additional queries may be acceptable. If an excessive number of queries would be necessary, one of the other two approaches is more appropriate.\n\nCaching, replication and non-normalized data[edit]\nInstead of only storing foreign keys, it is common to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each blog comment might include the username in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes, however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.[29]\n\n\nWith document databases like MongoDB it is common to put more data in a smaller number of collections. For example, in a blogging application, one might choose to store comments within the blog post document, so that with a single retrieval one gets all the comments. Thus in this approach a single document contains all the data needed for a specific task.\n\nACID and join support[edit]\nA database is marked as supporting ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) or join operations if the documentation for the database makes that claim. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the capability is fully supported in a manner similar to most SQL databases.\n\n\n\nDatabase\nACID\nJoins\n\n\nAerospike\nYes\nNo\n\n\nAgensGraph\nYes\nYes\n\n\nApache Ignite\nYes\nYes\n\n\nArangoDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nAmazon DynamoDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCouchbase\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCouchDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nIBM Db2\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInfinityDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nLMDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nMarkLogic\nYes\nYes[nb 1]\n\n\nMongoDB\nYes\nYes[nb 2]\n\n\nOrientDB\nYes\nYes[nb 3]\n\n\n^ Joins do not necessarily apply to document databases, but MarkLogic can do joins using semantics.[30]\n\n^ MongoDB did not support joining from a sharded collection until version 5.1.[31]\n\n^ OrientDB can resolve 1:1 joins using links by storing direct links to foreign records.[32]\n\n\nQuery optimization and indexing in NoSQL databases[edit]\nDifferent NoSQL databases, such as DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase, and Redis, exhibit varying behaviors when querying non-indexed fields. Many perform full-table or collection scans for such queries, applying filtering operations after retrieving data. However, modern NoSQL databases often incorporate advanced features to optimize query performance. For example, MongoDB supports compound indexes and query-optimization strategies, Cassandra offers secondary indexes and materialized views, and Redis employs custom indexing mechanisms tailored to specific use cases. Systems like Elasticsearch use inverted indexes for efficient text-based searches, but they can still require full scans for non-indexed fields. This behavior reflects the design focus of many NoSQL systems on scalability and efficient key-based operations rather than optimized querying for arbitrary fields. Consequently, while these databases excel at basic CRUD operations and key-based lookups, their suitability for complex queries involving joins or non-indexed filtering varies depending on the database type\u2014document, key\u2013value, wide-column, or graph\u2014and the specific implementation.

For the Microsoft technology, see COM Structured Storage.\nNoSQL (originally meaning \"Not only SQL\" or \"non-relational\")[1] refers to a type of database design that stores and retrieves data differently from the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which organize data into rows and columns like a spreadsheet, NoSQL databases use a single data structure\u2014such as key\u2013value pairs, wide columns, graphs, or documents\u2014to hold information. Since this non-relational design does not require a fixed schema, it scales easily to manage large, often unstructured datasets.[2] NoSQL systems are sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" because they can support SQL-like query languages or work alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent setups, where multiple database types are combined.[3][4] Non-relational databases date back to the late 1960s, but the term \"NoSQL\" emerged in the early 2000s, spurred by the needs of Web 2.0 companies like social media platforms.[5][6]\nNoSQL databases are popular in big data and real-time web applications due to their simple design, ability to scale across clusters of machines (called horizontal scaling), and precise control over data availability.[7][8] These structures can speed up certain tasks and are often considered more adaptable than fixed database tables.[9] However, many NoSQL systems prioritize speed and availability over strict consistency (per the CAP theorem), using eventual consistency\u2014where updates reach all nodes eventually, typically within milliseconds, but may cause brief delays in accessing the latest data, known as stale reads.[10] While most lack full ACID transaction support, some, like MongoDB, include it as a key feature.[11]\n\n\nBarriers to adoption[edit]\nBarriers to wider NoSQL adoption include their use of low-level query languages instead of SQL, inability to perform ad hoc joins across tables, lack of standardized interfaces, and significant investments already made in relational databases.[12] Some NoSQL systems risk losing data through lost writes or other forms, though features like write-ahead logging\u2014a method to record changes before they\u2019re applied\u2014can help prevent this.[13][14] For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, keeping data consistent is a challenge for both NoSQL and relational systems, as relational databases cannot enforce rules linking separate databases, and few systems support both ACID transactions and X/Open XA standards for managing distributed updates.[15][16] Limitations within the interface environment are overcome using semantic virtualization protocols, such that NoSQL services are accessible to most operating systems.[17]\n\n\nThe term NoSQL was used by Carlo Strozzi in 1998 to name his lightweight Strozzi NoSQL open-source relational database that did not expose the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) interface, but was still relational.[18] His NoSQL RDBMS is distinct from the around-2009 general concept of NoSQL databases.  Strozzi suggests that, because the current NoSQL movement \"departs from the relational model altogether, it should therefore have been called more appropriately 'NoREL'\",[19] referring to \"not relational\".\nJohan Oskarsson, then a developer at Last.fm, reintroduced the term NoSQL in early 2009 when he organized an event to discuss \"open-source distributed, non-relational databases\".[20] The name attempted to label the emergence of an increasing number of non-relational, distributed data stores, including open source clones of Google's Bigtable/MapReduce and Amazon's DynamoDB.\n\n\nThere are various ways to classify NoSQL databases, with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap. What follows is a non-exhaustive classification by data model, with examples:[21]\n\n\n\n\nType\nNotable examples of this type\n\n\nKey\u2013value cache\nApache Ignite, Couchbase, Coherence, eXtreme Scale, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Memcached, Redis, Velocity\n\n\nKey\u2013value store\nAzure Cosmos DB, ArangoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Aerospike, Couchbase, ScyllaDB\n\n\nKey\u2013value store (eventually consistent)\nAzure Cosmos DB, Oracle NoSQL Database, Riak, Voldemort\n\n\nKey\u2013value store (ordered)\nFoundationDB, InfinityDB, LMDB, MemcacheDB\n\n\nTuple store\nApache River, GigaSpaces, Tarantool, TIBCO ActiveSpaces, OpenLink Virtuoso\n\n\nTriplestore\n\nAllegroGraph, MarkLogic, Ontotext-OWLIM, Oracle NoSQL database, Profium Sense, Virtuoso Universal Server\n\n\nObject database\nObjectivity/DB, Perst, ZODB, db4o, GemStone/S, InterSystems Cach\u00e9, JADE, ObjectDatabase++, ObjectDB, ObjectStore, ODABA, Realm, OpenLink Virtuoso, Versant Object Database, Indexed Database API\n\n\nDocument store\nAzure Cosmos DB, ArangoDB, BaseX, Clusterpoint, Couchbase, CouchDB, DocumentDB, eXist-db, Google Cloud Firestore, IBM Domino, MarkLogic, MongoDB, RavenDB, Qizx, RethinkDB, Elasticsearch, OrientDB\n\n\nWide-column store\nAzure Cosmos DB, Amazon DynamoDB, Bigtable, Cassandra, Google Cloud Datastore, HBase, Hypertable, ScyllaDB\n\n\nNative multi-model database\nArangoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, OrientDB, MarkLogic, Apache Ignite,[22][23] Couchbase, FoundationDB, Oracle Database, AgensGraph\n\n\nGraph database\n\nAzure Cosmos DB, AllegroGraph, ArangoDB, Apache Giraph, GUN (Graph Universe Node), InfiniteGraph,  MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso\n\n\nMultivalue database\n\nD3 Pick database, Extensible Storage Engine (ESE/NT), InfinityDB, InterSystems Cach\u00e9, jBASE Pick database, mvBase Rocket Software, mvEnterprise Rocket Software, Northgate Information Solutions Reality (the original Pick/MV Database), OpenQM, Revelation Software's OpenInsight (Windows) and Advanced Revelation (DOS), UniData Rocket U2, UniVerse Rocket U2\n\n\n\nKey\u2013value (KV) stores use the associative array (also called a map or dictionary) as their fundamental data model. In this model, data is represented as a collection of key\u2013value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.[24][25]\nThe key\u2013value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and richer data models are often implemented as an extension of it. The key\u2013value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that maintains keys in lexicographic order. This extension is computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective key ranges.[26]\nKey\u2013value stores can use consistency models ranging from eventual consistency to serializability. Some databases support ordering of keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users store data in memory (RAM), while others on solid-state drives (SSD) or rotating disks (aka hard disk drive (HDD)).\n\n\n\nThe central concept of a document store is that of a \"document\". While the details of this definition differ among document-oriented databases, they all assume that documents encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard formats or encodings. Encodings in use include XML, YAML, and JSON and binary forms like BSON. Documents are addressed in the database via a unique key that represents that document. Another defining characteristic of a document-oriented database is an API or query language to retrieve documents based on their contents.\nDifferent implementations offer different ways of organizing and/or grouping documents:\n\nCollections\nTags\nNon-visible metadata\nDirectory hierarchies\nCompared to relational databases, collections could be considered analogous to tables and documents analogous to records.

    "text": "\"Structured storage\" redirects here. For the Microsoft technology, see COM Structured Storage.\nNoSQL (originally meaning \"Not only SQL\" or \"non-relational\")[1] refers to a type of database design that stores and retrieves data differently from the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which organize data into rows and columns like a spreadsheet, NoSQL databases use a single data structure\u2014such as key\u2013value pairs, wide columns, graphs, or documents\u2014to hold information. Since this non-relational design does not require a fixed schema, it scales easily to manage large, often unstructured datasets.[2] NoSQL systems are sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" because they can support SQL-like query languages or work alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent setups, where multiple database types are combined.[3][4] Non-relational databases date back to the late 1960s, but the term \"NoSQL\" emerged in the early 2000s, spurred by the needs of Web 2.0 companies like social media platforms.[5][6]\nNoSQL databases are popular in big data and real-time web applications due to their simple design, ability to scale across clusters of machines (called horizontal scaling), and precise control over data availability.[7][8] These structures can speed up certain tasks and are often considered more adaptable than fixed database tables.[9] However, many NoSQL systems prioritize speed and availability over strict consistency (per the CAP theorem), using eventual consistency\u2014where updates reach all nodes eventually, typically within milliseconds, but may cause brief delays in accessing the latest data, known as stale reads.[10] While most lack full ACID transaction support, some, like MongoDB, include it as a key feature.[11]\n\n\nBarriers to adoption[edit]\nBarriers to wider NoSQL adoption include their use of low-level query languages instead of SQL, inability to perform ad hoc joins across tables, lack of standardized interfaces, and significant investments already made in relational databases.[12] Some NoSQL systems risk losing data through lost writes or other forms, though features like write-ahead logging\u2014a method to record changes before they\u2019re applied\u2014can help prevent this.[13][14] For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, keeping data consistent is a challenge for both NoSQL and relational systems, as relational databases cannot enforce rules linking separate databases, and few systems support both ACID transactions and X/Open XA standards for managing distributed updates.[15][16] Limitations within the interface environment are overcome using semantic virtualization protocols, such that NoSQL services are accessible to most operating systems.[17]\n\n\nThe term NoSQL was used by Carlo Strozzi in 1998 to name his lightweight Strozzi NoSQL open-source relational database that did not expose the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) interface, but was still relational.[18] His NoSQL RDBMS is distinct from the around-2009 general concept of NoSQL databases.  Strozzi suggests that, because the current NoSQL movement \"departs from the relational model altogether, it should therefore have been called more appropriately 'NoREL'\",[19] referring to \"not relational\".\nJohan Oskarsson, then a developer at Last.fm, reintroduced the term NoSQL in early 2009 when he organized an event to discuss \"open-source distributed, non-relational databases\".[20] The name attempted to label the emergence of an increasing number of non-relational, distributed data stores, including open source clones of Google's Bigtable/MapReduce and Amazon's DynamoDB.\n\n\nThere are various ways to classify NoSQL databases, with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap. What follows is a non-exhaustive classification by data model, with examples:[21]\n\n\n\n\nType\nNotable examples of this type\n\n\nKey\u2013value cache\nApache Ignite, Couchbase, Coherence, eXtreme Scale, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Memcached, Redis, Velocity\n\n\nKey\u2013value store\nAzure Cosmos DB, ArangoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Aerospike, Couchbase, ScyllaDB\n\n\nKey\u2013value store (eventually consistent)\nAzure Cosmos DB, Oracle NoSQL Database, Riak, Voldemort\n\n\nKey\u2013value store (ordered)\nFoundationDB, InfinityDB, LMDB, MemcacheDB\n\n\nTuple store\nApache River, GigaSpaces, Tarantool, TIBCO ActiveSpaces, OpenLink Virtuoso\n\n\nTriplestore\n\nAllegroGraph, MarkLogic, Ontotext-OWLIM, Oracle NoSQL database, Profium Sense, Virtuoso Universal Server\n\n\nObject database\nObjectivity/DB, Perst, ZODB, db4o, GemStone/S, InterSystems Cach\u00e9, JADE, ObjectDatabase++, ObjectDB, ObjectStore, ODABA, Realm, OpenLink Virtuoso, Versant Object Database, Indexed Database API\n\n\nDocument store\nAzure Cosmos DB, ArangoDB, BaseX, Clusterpoint, Couchbase, CouchDB, DocumentDB, eXist-db, Google Cloud Firestore, IBM Domino, MarkLogic, MongoDB, RavenDB, Qizx, RethinkDB, Elasticsearch, OrientDB\n\n\nWide-column store\nAzure Cosmos DB, Amazon DynamoDB, Bigtable, Cassandra, Google Cloud Datastore, HBase, Hypertable, ScyllaDB\n\n\nNative multi-model database\nArangoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, OrientDB, MarkLogic, Apache Ignite,[22][23] Couchbase, FoundationDB, Oracle Database, AgensGraph\n\n\nGraph database\n\nAzure Cosmos DB, AllegroGraph, ArangoDB, Apache Giraph, GUN (Graph Universe Node), InfiniteGraph,  MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso\n\n\nMultivalue database\n\nD3 Pick database, Extensible Storage Engine (ESE/NT), InfinityDB, InterSystems Cach\u00e9, jBASE Pick database, mvBase Rocket Software, mvEnterprise Rocket Software, Northgate Information Solutions Reality (the original Pick/MV Database), OpenQM, Revelation Software's OpenInsight (Windows) and Advanced Revelation (DOS), UniData Rocket U2, UniVerse Rocket U2\n\n\n\nKey\u2013value (KV) stores use the associative array (also called a map or dictionary) as their fundamental data model. In this model, data is represented as a collection of key\u2013value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.[24][25]\nThe key\u2013value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and richer data models are often implemented as an extension of it. The key\u2013value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that maintains keys in lexicographic order. This extension is computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective key ranges.[26]\nKey\u2013value stores can use consistency models ranging from eventual consistency to serializability. Some databases support ordering of keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users store data in memory (RAM), while others on solid-state drives (SSD) or rotating disks (aka hard disk drive (HDD)).\n\n\n\nThe central concept of a document store is that of a \"document\". While the details of this definition differ among document-oriented databases, they all assume that documents encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard formats or encodings. Encodings in use include XML, YAML, and JSON and binary forms like BSON. Documents are addressed in the database via a unique key that represents that document. Another defining characteristic of a document-oriented database is an API or query language to retrieve documents based on their contents.\nDifferent implementations offer different ways of organizing and/or grouping documents:\n\nCollections\nTags\nNon-visible metadata\nDirectory hierarchies\nCompared to relational databases, collections could be considered analogous to tables and documents analogous to records. But they are different \u2013 every record in a table has the same sequence of fields, while documents in a collection may have fields that are completely different.\n\n\n\nGraph databases are designed for data whose relations are well represented as a graph consisting of elements connected by a finite number of relations. Examples of data include social relations, public transport links, road maps, network topologies, etc.\n\nGraph databases and their query language\n\n\nName\nLanguage(s)\nNotes\n\n\nAgensGraph\nCypher\nMulti-model graph database\n\n\nAllegroGraph\nSPARQL\nRDF triple store\n\n\nAmazon Neptune\nGremlin, SPARQL\nGraph database\n\n\nArangoDB\nAQL, JavaScript, GraphQL\nMulti-model DBMS Document, Graph database and Key-value store\n\n\nAzure Cosmos DB\nGremlin\nGraph database\n\n\nDEX/Sparksee\nC++, Java, C#, Python\nGraph database\n\n\nFlockDB\nScala\nGraph database\n\n\nGUN (Graph Universe Node)\nJavaScript\nGraph database\n\n\nIBM Db2\nSPARQL\nRDF triple store added in DB2 10\n\n\nInfiniteGraph\nJava\nGraph database\n\n\nJanusGraph\nJava\nGraph database\n\n\nMarkLogic\nJava, JavaScript, SPARQL, XQuery\nMulti-model document database and RDF triple store\n\n\nNeo4j\nCypher\nGraph database\n\n\nOpenLink Virtuoso\nC++, C#, Java, SPARQL\nMiddleware and database engine hybrid\n\n\nOracle\nSPARQL 1.1\nRDF triple store added in 11g\n\n\nOrientDB\nJava, SQL\nMulti-model document and graph database\n\n\nOWLIM\nJava, SPARQL 1.1\nRDF triple store\n\n\nProfium Sense\nJava, SPARQL\nRDF triple store\n\n\nRedisGraph\nCypher\nGraph database\n\n\nSqrrl Enterprise\nJava\nGraph database\n\n\nTerminusDB\n\nJavaScript, Python, datalog\n\nOpen source RDF triple-store and document store[27]\n\n\nThe performance of NoSQL databases is usually evaluated using the metric of throughput, which is measured as operations per second. Performance evaluation must pay attention to the right benchmarks such as production configurations, parameters of the databases, anticipated data volume, and concurrent user workloads.\nBen Scofield rated different categories of NoSQL databases as follows:[28]\n\n\n\nData model\nPerformance\nScalability\nFlexibility\nComplexity\nData integrity\nFunctionality\n\n\nKey\u2013value store\nhigh\nhigh\nhigh\nnone\nlow\nvariable (none)\n\n\nColumn-oriented store\nhigh\nhigh\nmoderate\nlow\nlow\nminimal\n\n\nDocument-oriented store\nhigh\nvariable (high)\nhigh\nlow\nlow\nvariable (low)\n\n\nGraph database\nvariable\nvariable\nhigh\nhigh\nlow-med\ngraph theory\n\n\nRelational database\nvariable\nvariable\nlow\nmoderate\nhigh\nrelational algebra\n\nPerformance and scalability comparisons are most commonly done using the YCSB benchmark.\n\nHandling relational data[edit]\nSince most NoSQL databases lack ability for joins in queries, the database schema generally needs to be designed differently. There are three main techniques for handling relational data in a NoSQL database. (See table join and ACID support for NoSQL databases that support joins.)\n\n\nInstead of retrieving all the data with one query, it is common to do several queries to get the desired data. NoSQL queries are often faster than traditional SQL queries, so the cost of additional queries may be acceptable. If an excessive number of queries would be necessary, one of the other two approaches is more appropriate.\n\nCaching, replication and non-normalized data[edit]\nInstead of only storing foreign keys, it is common to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each blog comment might include the username in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes, however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.[29]\n\n\nWith document databases like MongoDB it is common to put more data in a smaller number of collections. For example, in a blogging application, one might choose to store comments within the blog post document, so that with a single retrieval one gets all the comments. Thus in this approach a single document contains all the data needed for a specific task.\n\nACID and join support[edit]\nA database is marked as supporting ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) or join operations if the documentation for the database makes that claim. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the capability is fully supported in a manner similar to most SQL databases.\n\n\n\nDatabase\nACID\nJoins\n\n\nAerospike\nYes\nNo\n\n\nAgensGraph\nYes\nYes\n\n\nApache Ignite\nYes\nYes\n\n\nArangoDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nAmazon DynamoDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCouchbase\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCouchDB\nYes\nYes\n\n\nIBM Db2\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInfinityDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nLMDB\nYes\nNo\n\n\nMarkLogic\nYes\nYes[nb 1]\n\n\nMongoDB\nYes\nYes[nb 2]\n\n\nOrientDB\nYes\nYes[nb 3]\n\n\n^ Joins do not necessarily apply to document databases, but MarkLogic can do joins using semantics.[30]\n\n^ MongoDB did not support joining from a sharded collection until version 5.1.[31]\n\n^ OrientDB can resolve 1:1 joins using links by storing direct links to foreign records.[32]\n\n\nQuery optimization and indexing in NoSQL databases[edit]\nDifferent NoSQL databases, such as DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase, and Redis, exhibit varying behaviors when querying non-indexed fields. Many perform full-table or collection scans for such queries, applying filtering operations after retrieving data. However, modern NoSQL databases often incorporate advanced features to optimize query performance. For example, MongoDB supports compound indexes and query-optimization strategies, Cassandra offers secondary indexes and materialized views, and Redis employs custom indexing mechanisms tailored to specific use cases. Systems like Elasticsearch use inverted indexes for efficient text-based searches, but they can still require full scans for non-indexed fields. This behavior reflects the design focus of many NoSQL systems on scalability and efficient key-based operations rather than optimized querying for arbitrary fields. Consequently, while these databases excel at basic CRUD operations and key-based lookups, their suitability for complex queries involving joins or non-indexed filtering varies depending on the database type\u2014document, key\u2013value, wide-column, or graph\u2014and the specific implementation.

It is the fifth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh entry overall. Set within the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, the game follows Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, who returns home in 1992 after his mother's murder and finds his old street gang has lost much of their territory. Over the course of the game, he attempts to rebuild the gang, clashes with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals, and gradually unravels the truth behind his mother's murder.\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam San Andreas, consisting of three major metropolitan cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas, based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively. Rockstar conducted on-site research in each city and consulted Los Angeles natives DJ Pooh, Estevan Oriol, and Mister Cartoon for help imitating the city's culture. The narrative is based on multiple real-life events in Los Angeles, including the Bloods and Crips street gang rivalry, the 1990s crack epidemic, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and the Rampart scandal. The 50-person development team spent nearly two years creating the game. San Andreas was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2.\nThe game received critical acclaim for its characters, narrative, open world design, and visual fidelity, but mixed responses towards its mission design, technical issues, and portrayal of race. It generated controversy when the hidden \"Hot Coffee\" sex minigame was discovered, briefly requiring the game to be re-rated Adults Only. San Andreas received year-end accolades from several gaming publications, and it is considered one of the sixth generation of console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made. It was released for Windows and the Xbox in 2005, followed by enhanced versions and mobile ports in the 2010s, and a remastered version in 2021. San Andreas is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game with over 17.3\u00a0million copies sold, and one of the best-selling games of all time with 27.5\u00a0million copies sold overall. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released in April 2008.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game is played from a third-person view and its open world can be navigated using cars and other vehicles.[2][3]\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.[2] In the game, players control criminal Carl \"CJ\" Johnson and complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world and complete optional side missions.[4][5] A multiplayer mode allows two players to roam the world.[6] The fictional state of San Andreas, which makes up the open world, comprises three metropolitan cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas.[7] The cities are unlocked as the story progresses;[8] airports allow teleportation between each city using fast travel.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Scattered throughout the map, safehouses can be purchased to save the game and store vehicles.[9]:\u200a20\u200a\nPlayers may run, swim, and use vehicles to navigate the world,[3] and use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, including the ability to dual wield firearms and commit drive-by shootings.[10][11] Weapons are purchased from local firearms dealers, retrieved from dead enemies, and found scattered through the world.[12] In combat, auto-aim is used to lock on to targets.[9]:\u200a42\u200a Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through health pick-ups, and body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage.[10][13] Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes.[14]:\u200a100\u200a If players commit crimes, law enforcement may respond as indicated by a \"wanted\" meter in the head-up display. Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level; at the maximum six-star level, police helicopters and military are sent after players.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.[9]:\u200a29\u200a The game features more than 180 vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, aircraft, boats, and remote-control vehicles,[9]:\u200a6\u201311\u200a and most can be accessorised with modifications like hydraulics, nitrous oxide engines, and stereo systems.[9]:\u200a201\u2013204\u200a\n\nPlayers can fight members from enemy gangs to earn their territory.[9]:\u200a196\u200a\nIn the world, players can fight for territory by attacking rival gang members; the territory is won when players survive three waves of responding enemy attacks. Won territories are subject to periodic enemy gang attacks\u2014they must be successfully defended or else lost.[9]:\u200a196\u200a While free roaming the world, players may engage in activities such as burglary, fire fighting, pimping, taxi, and vigilante missions;[9]:\u200a176\u2013180\u200a completion rewards players with cash, which can be spent on CJ's accessories, clothing, hairstyles, and tattoos\u2014new role-playing elements for the series.[10][15] Balancing food and physical activity impacts CJ's appearance and physical attributes; eating and exercising maintains health, while losing muscle lessens combat effectiveness.[16] Three styles of hand-to-hand combat\u2014boxing, kickboxing, and mixed martial arts\u2014are taught at gyms in each city.[9]:\u200a144\u2013145\u200a[17]:\u200a31\u200a The game tracks respect among CJ's friends, which varies according to his actions and appearance.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Acquired skills are also tracked, such as driving, firearms handling, lung capacity, muscles, and stamina, which unlock additional game mechanics.[3][9]:\u200a4\u200a Players can date six different girls and take them to dinner, drinks, or dancing.[9]:\u200a200\u2013201\u200a\n\nPlot\nIn 1992, after five years in Liberty City, gangster Carl \"CJ\" Johnson (Young Maylay) returns to Los Santos following his mother's death in a drive-by shooting. He is intercepted by corrupt C.R.A.S.H. officers led by Frank Tenpenny (Samuel L. Jackson), who threaten to implicate CJ in the killing of a fellow police officer unless he co-operates with them. CJ returns to Grove Street and reunites with his brother Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson (Faizon Love), sister Kendl Johnson (Yolanda Whittaker), and members of his old gang, Big Smoke (Clifton Powell) and Ryder (MC Eiht). Discovering the Grove Street Families (GSF) have lost much of their territory, CJ restores the gang to power by helping reunite the various GSF sets who had splintered and allying himself with Cesar Vialpando (Clifton Collins Jr.)\u2014Kendl's boyfriend and leader of the Varrios Los Aztecas gang. CJ and Cesar witness Smoke and Ryder meeting with Tenpenny and the rival Ballas gang, and discover they betrayed the GSF and were responsible for killing CJ's mother. Suspecting a set-up, CJ rushes to Sweet's aid in a showdown against the Ballas.\nSweet gets wounded in the ambush and imprisoned, while Tenpenny exiles CJ to the countryside, where he forces him to eliminate witnesses to C.R.A.S.H.'s corruption in exchange for Sweet's safety in prison. CJ befriends an aging hippie and marijuana farmer named \"the Truth\" (Peter Fonda) and Triad leader Wu Zi Mu (James Yaegashi). He participates in a street race and wins a garage in San Fierro, which he sets up to earn money, and crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Big Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. Infiltrating the organisation, he identifies its leader: the affable but mysterious Mike Toreno (James Woods). Alongside Cesar and the Triad, CJ destroys the Loco Syndicate's drug factory and kills their leaders and Ryder. Toreno reveals himself to be an undercover government agent and enlists CJ's help in several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's release from prison. Meanwhile, CJ and Wu Zi Mu establish a casino in Las Venturas, where they clash against a rival, Mafia-run casino.\nAfter his release, Sweet and CJ revive the GSF, drive off the rival gangs from their territory, and rebuild throughout Los Santos. Tenpenny is arrested and tried for several felonies, but the charges are dropped due to lack of witnesses, prompting a city-wide riot. CJ soon discovers Big Smoke's hideout. The two engage in a gunfight; CJ wins, and before dying, Smoke confesses that he got caught up in power and money. Tenpenny arrives, holds CJ at gunpoint while he steals Smoke's drug money, and causes an explosion in the building to escape. He drives off in a fire truck, followed by CJ and Sweet, but eventually loses control of the vehicle and crashes over the side of a bridge overlooking Grove Street. CJ and his friends watch as Tenpenny dies of his injuries, ending the riot. In the aftermath, CJ's family and friends celebrate their success at the Johnson house. In the midst of the celebrations, CJ leaves to check on the neighbourhood.\n\nDevelopment\nLike the two previous Grand Theft Auto entries, Benzies produced San Andreas with Dan Houser, who also co-wrote the story. Sam Houser, president of Rockstar Games, was executive producer.[18]:\u200a20\u201321\u200a\nThe 50-person team at Rockstar North began development of San Andreas following the release of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in October 2002.[19][20] Having two years of development, as opposed to Vice City's one, gave them more opportunities to experiment and reevaluate the previous Grand Theft Auto games.[20] Producer Leslie Benzies hoped San Andreas would redefine the series and \"revolutionize open-ended gameplay and video game production values\".[21] Rockstar Games's The Warriors, originally scheduled to be released in 2004, was delayed to 2005 to provide additional resources to San Andreas.[22] San Andreas had a budget of under US$10 million.[23]\nRockstar North's minimal turnover since the development of the series's first game, Grand Theft Auto (1997), allowed the team to leverage their experience with the series.[24]:\u200a57\u200a Some developers were concerned about working conditions at Rockstar during San Andreas's development, as they were unable to take an adequate break after Vice City. Programmer Gary Foreman feared the company had entered a \"constant crunch\", as some developers worked for 17 hours per day.[25]:\u200a138\u200a Some stepped away after disagreements with Rockstar president Sam Houser about working conditions,[25]:\u200a139\u2013141,\u200a160\u200a and one veteran employee quit in objection to the portrayal of African Americans and what he perceived to be a gloomier and more exploitative tone in Rockstar's output, particularly San Andreas and Rockstar North's previous game, Manhunt (2003).[25]:\u200a167\u200a\n\nTechnical and open world design\n\n\nWe love L.A., and the whole gangbanging vibe, and the street culture. That time [early '90s] in L.A. is so important and we knew a long time ago that the franchise needed to end up there. We'd done the East Coast in GTA3, and then '80s Miami with Vice City, so going to L.A. in the early '90s just seemed like an obvious place for us to go.\n\n\n\n\nSan Andreas's world was originally envisioned as three separate maps connected by public transport; it later became three cities in one map, with countryside and desert in between.[19] Its cities are inspired by real locations: Los Santos by Los Angeles, San Fierro by San Francisco, and Las Venturas by Las Vegas.[7][27]:\u200a44\u200a Early in development, the team travelled to each city for research and photography;[28]:\u200a61\u200a[29]:\u200a40\u200a art director Aaron Garbut felt Los Angeles's gang territory in particular was difficult to capture without first-hand experience.[20] Rockstar's New York-based research team took thousands of photographs and video,[20][28]:\u200a61\u200a some of which were used as textures in the game.[19] San Andreas's world is 36 square kilometres (14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[30] about four to six times larger than Grand Theft Auto III's and Vice City's;[27]:\u200a44\u200a each city in San Andreas is approximately as large as Vice City.[31] Garbut found it more difficult to memorise San Andreas's larger map than its predecessors'.[28]:\u200a61\u200a The team wanted all elements\u2014including packaging and marketing\u2014to maintain a consistent theme to ensure players felt they were connected.[32][33]:\u200a47\u200a\nBenzies felt Rockstar North's relationship with Los Angeles natives Estevan Oriol, Mister Cartoon, and DJ Pooh helped them imitate the city's 1990s street culture.[29]:\u200a40\u200a The team wanted to ensure the world looked neither too \"toy-towny\" nor too precise,[32] as they sought \"depth\" over quantitative size; Garbut wanted players to \"feel like [they] can stop at any point and discover new things\".[20] Real-world areas were the inspiration for many in-game locations: Compton for Los Santos's urban areas, and the Golden Gate Bridge for the Gant Bridge.[34][35] The team were enthusiastic about the inclusion of mountains, forests, and a desert\u2014firsts for the series.[20][36] San Fierro's hills, based on those in San Francisco, were intended to draw the player's focus towards vehicle gameplay,[27]:\u200a45\u200a and the open countryside driving was inspired from a technical perspective by Rockstar's Smuggler's Run (2002).[37]:\u200a42\u200a Producer and co-writer Dan Houser felt the game's return to Los Santos in the final act afforded players a chance to view it from a different perspective.[38]:\u200a122\u200a Garbut established climate zones for each city represented by their sky colour: Los Santos's red-orange, San Fierro's blue, and Las Venturas's red.[19]\nSan Andreas was built using the game engine RenderWare.[39]:\u200a74\u200a Its render pipeline was rewritten for increased graphical detail and scope,[32] allowing 35\u201350% more polygons on screen,[39]:\u200a74\u200a real-time reflections and volumetric lighting, and unique models and lighting sets for day and night.[20][27]:\u200a45\u200a According to Garbut, the world is built with around 16,000 unique objects and buildings.[28]:\u200a61\u200a Several buildings share a single low-detail model,[30] allowing them to be loaded as players traverse the map without the interruption of loading screens like in Vice City.[38]:\u200a122\u200a Textures were created at a high resolution and scaled down for platforms unable to handle them.[30] The driving physics were reworked from previous games in consideration of San Andreas's more open areas.[32] Manhunt inspired San Andreas's stealth elements,[33]:\u200a49\u200a and the \"physicality\" of Manhunt's targeting and gun gameplay was adapted to the open world formula.[40] Computer scripting advancements enabled the developers to create gameplay features not possible in their previous games, such as the casino minigames.[30]\n\nStory and characters\nSeveral historical events influenced the narrative, including the Rampart scandal of the Los Angeles Police Department,[41] the 1990s crack epidemic, the 1992 Los Angeles riots,[42] and the rivalry between the Bloods and Crips street gangs.[43] Sam Houser recounted being fascinated by the appearances of street gangs and terrified by their behaviour;[44] the writers sought to accurately portray gang violence without glorifying it,[24]:\u200a54\u200a and wanted each gang to act differently, signified by unique walking styles.[19] DJ Pooh was hired to co-write the game from an American perspective.[25]:\u200a189\u200a The narrative was influenced by Hollywood films; Dan Houser said the team watched \"hundreds of movies to get the California vibe\".[36] The developers referenced Boyz n the Hood (1991), Colors (1988), and Menace II Society (1993) for narrative inspiration, and compared their in-game locations to those in different films: the countryside to Deliverance (1972), San Fierro to Bullitt (1968), and Las Venturas to Casino (1995).[39]:\u200a77\u200a Journalists identified references to other films like Juice (1992) and New Jack City (1991).[45][46][47][48] The focus on several communities was prompted by the variety in West Coast culture in the 1990s.[40]\nWhile the stories are largely unconnected, San Andreas concluded a trilogy that started with Grand Theft Auto III, allowing Rockstar to explore the 1980s (Vice City), 1990s (San Andreas), and early 2000s (III).[40] The team felt \"the world's attention was on California\" in the 1990s in regards to news and music, and that it translated well to the game.[39]:\u200a77\u200a Dan Houser said the game's satire was aimed towards the \"broader weirdness\" of American consumerism and action movies.[32] He noted the writers attempted to outdo each other's humour.[32] The team wanted to give players the freedom to make choices while maintaining interest in the story.[32] The game features over 400 speaking actors[32] and over 60,000 lines of dialogue, including over 7,700[b] for CJ;[49] it broke a Guinness World Record for the largest video game voice cast with 861 credited actors.[50] Each non-player character had around an hour of dialogue, in contrast to Vice City's ten minutes.[39]:\u200a71\u200a\nSam Houser sought an unknown actor for CJ, as he found Ray Liotta's performance as Tommy Vercetti in Vice City \"conflicting\" due to his familiarity with Liotta's previous work. He opted to cast celebrities in secondary roles, such as Jackson as Tenpenny, and he felt Young Maylay's obscurity in the industry made CJ feel \"very, very human\".[51] Rockstar asked Young Maylay to audition after overhearing him speak with DJ Pooh; he was cast in the role\u2014his first acting performance\u2014a few weeks after auditioning.[52]:\u200a41\u200a He felt the developers gave him the freedom to imbue CJ with his own personality.[53] They aimed for CJ to be their \"most human\" character, ensuring he had \"the most intense story around him\" to allow players to identify.[24]:\u200a54\u200a DJ Pooh compared CJ to Tupac Shakur in his fierce dedication to family but ability to become \"cold-blooded\" when necessary.[54]:\u200a49\u200a The team felt the ability to adjust CJ's weight helped players feel their actions could have consequences.[40] Dan Houser felt CJ's customisability allowed players to better connect with the characters.[27]:\u200a50\u200a DJ Pooh engaged several other actors to work on the game, such as Faizon Love, MC Eiht, and Shawn Fonteno.[19]\n\nMusic\n\nRockstar partnered with Interscope Records to create the soundtrack.[55] The in-game radio features eleven radio stations with twenty DJs\u2014including Axl Rose, Chuck D, and George Clinton[56]\u2014and more than three times as many licensed songs and original in-universe advertisements as Grand Theft Auto III. The radio features were overhauled; instead of looping sounds, each station became dynamic, allowing a randomised song order, accurate weather predictions, and story-relevant news announcements.[57] Michael Hunter wrote the game's main theme,[58] partly inspired by his childhood experiences with hip hop through Yo! MTV Raps (1988\u20131995).[19] Interscope published two albums for the game: a two-disc album in November 2004,[59] and an eight-disc box set in December.[60] Post-PlayStation 2 versions of the game added an additional radio station supporting a custom, user-imported soundtrack.[61]\n\n\nIn October 2003, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive announced the next Grand Theft Auto game would be released in 2004's third quarter,[62] and it prompted speculation after registering GTA: San Andreas with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2003.[63] Rockstar announced the game in March 2004, along with a scheduled release date of 19 and 22 October in North America and Europe, respectively.[21] The first details and screenshots were released at E3 in May[47] alongside a cover story in Game Informer,[64] followed by the cover art in July.[65] Rockstar launched the official website and first trailer in August,[66][67] followed by the second trailer in September.[68][69] In September, Take-Two announced the game's delay to 26 and 29\u00a0October in North America and Europe, respectively, and revealed it would be released for Windows in early 2005.[70] Rockstar commissioned hand-painted advertisements for San Andreas around the world in late 2004; one in Melbourne remained partially visible in 2020.[71]\nIn October 2004, an early version of the game was leaked by hackers;[72] Rockstar asserted it would \"aggressively pursue this matter\" and asked for information.[73] The game was released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004.[70] A special edition version was published for the PlayStation 2 on 8\u00a0October 2005, featuring Rockstar's debut documentary film Sunday Driver, about a lowrider car club in Compton.[74] It also included The Introduction,[75] an in-engine video previously provided on a DVD with the game's soundtrack.[59] The 21-minute video chronicles the events leading up to San Andreas, featuring CJ, Sweet, Big Smoke, Ryder, and Tenpenny.[76] GameSpot recommended the film for fans of the series;[77] IGN's Chris Carle enjoyed the voice acting but found the narrative uncompelling and felt the film alone was not worth purchasing the special edition.[75] Capcom published the game in Japan on 25\u00a0January 2007.[78][79]\n\nReception\nCritical response\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[80] It is the site's fifth-highest-rated PlayStation 2 game.[87] PSM2's Daniel Dawkins declared it \"the single most complete, unique, universe in console history\" after The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) and \"the best entertainment console gaming can offer\".[88] Game Informer's Andrew Reiner called it \"entertainment at its best\"[84] and GameSpy's Miguel Lopez wrote it reminded him why he plays games: \"to be liberated from the constraints of reality, and explore living, breathing worlds\".[89]\nSeveral reviewers considered San Andreas's world an improvement over its predecessors',[84][86][90] praising the attention to detail in its areas and characters;[10][91] IGN's Jeremy Dunham cited the differences in each city's weather as a highlight.[10] 1Up.com's Jeremy Parish considered it \"the most complete, complex and detailed environment ever crafted for a game\", praising the complexities of the freeway system and social dynamics.[90] GameSpy's Lopez lauded its accurate imitation of the American West Coast.[92] Critics considered the graphics an improvement over Vice City,[91][93] particularly regarding the animations, foliage, lighting, and weather effects;[3][10][83] PALGN's Chris Sell called it \"one of the most visually absorbing games ever\".[86] Criticism was directed at the game's technical issues, with several reviewers encountering pop-up,[10][86][88] and unstable frame rates;[3][90][91] some felt the game pushed the PlayStation 2 hardware to its limit.[90][91]\nGame Informer's Reiner considered gameplay a dramatic improvement over previous entries.[84] PSM2's Dawkins found the missions were rarely repetitive and blended difficulty with comedy.[94] GameRevolution's Joe Dodson lauded the freedom provided to players,[83] while 1Up.com's Parish felt the previous games' improvisation had been removed[95] and Electronic Gaming Monthly's Dan Hsu thought it could have benefited from branching paths.[81] The New York Times's Charles Herold found the game's structure diminished enjoyment of its missions, forcing players to drive long distances and replay extensive sequences upon failing,[96] a complaint echoed by others.[83][86][91] Some reviewers criticised the combat targeting (though acknowledged the usefulness of auto-aim)[10][86][91] and the flight, racing, RC car, and minigame controls.[86][91][97][95] The addition of role-playing elements was praised for its simplicity, subtlety, and effectiveness,[3][81][91][98] though 1Up.com's Parish denounced some missions' statistical prerequisites.[95]\n\n\nSeveral critics considered the narrative the series' best to date,[10][86] which Eurogamer's Kristan Reed attributed to its focus on dialogue and scene-setting, both in and out of cutscenes.[91] Game Informer's Matt Miller enjoyed the narrative's ridicule of modern culture.[84] Some reviewers compared the story to Hollywood films and similar popular culture;[84][99] PSM2's Dawkins felt the finale \"outstrips the collected work\" of filmmakers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson.[94] Critics praised the cast's performances, particularly that of Young Maylay, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, and David Cross.[3][84][97] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine's John Davison considered CJ \"possibly one of the most well-developed and believable videogame characters ever made\" due to his layered personality and realistic behaviour;[93] 1Up.com's Parish concurred but felt CJ's kind nature made his in-game actions less believable, a problem that may have been circumvented through a branching narrative.[99]\nSome critics and scholars criticised the game for perpetuating racial stereotypes.[100][101][102][103] Seeing Black's Esther Iverem condemned the series for \"validating ... an accepted caricature\" rather than teaching respect and tolerance.[103] Dean Chan felt the series' protagonist shift from Tommy (an Italian American) to CJ (an African American) without subverting archetypes made it \"complicit in the pathologization and fetishization of race\".[104]:\u200a25\u200a Paul Barrett found its disregard and decontextualisation of institutional racism's structures suggest \"that the problems that African Americans experience is due to individual failure\", reinforced by the concept that white players can simply experience \"black identity\".[105]:\u200a114\u200a A Games and Culture study found youth groups \"do not passively receive the games' images and content\": white players expressed concern about its racial stereotypes, while African American players used it \"as a framework to discuss institutional racism\".[106]:\u200a264,\u200a279\u200a Rachael Hutchinson considered San Andreas \"a critical reflection on racial conflict in America\" and found several criticisms were based on limited viewings instead of the whole story.[107]:\u200a174\u2013175\u200a Kotaku opined some in-game interactions could be portrayed as a lack of racism, such as characters conversing without moderating vocabularies or commenting on others'.[108] 1Up.com's Parish lauded the references to Rodney King's assault and the sophisticated writing addressing race in South Central Los Angeles.[99] David J. Leonard felt politicians and legislators were more concerned about the game's violent and sexual content than its racial stereotypes.[102]:\u200a268\u200a\n\nWindows and Xbox versions\n\nSan Andreas's June 2005 release for Windows and Xbox received \"universal acclaim\" according to Metacritic.[80] It was the second-highest-rated Windows game of 2005, behind Civilization IV,[119] and the third-highest-rated Xbox game, behind Ninja Gaiden Black and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.[120]\nPALGN's Matt Keller considered the Windows release the best version of the game.[117] Reviewers lauded the improved graphics,[117][121] particularly the detailed textures and models, higher draw distance, and improved frame rate, loading times, and anti-aliasing,[109][117][122][123] though some considered the graphics outdated for the platform.[115][124] PALGN's Keller found the increased population density improved the world's overall atmosphere.[117] The mouse and keyboard controls were generally praised as an improvement over the console versions and the series' previous Windows ports,[117][123][125] especially during combat gameplay,[11][115][117][126] though responses to driving controls and keyboard mapping were mixed.[109][115][121] Praise was directed at the custom radio[109][125] and physical packaging and manual.[11][126] Some critics bemoaned the lack of changes to the mission structure,[122][123] and some encountered technical difficulties like sudden and major lagging spikes.[113][126]\nGameZone's Eduardo Zacarias called the Xbox release the \"definitive version of the game\",[114] and GameSpy's Will Tuttle considered it better than the original.[127] Several reviewers praised the improved assets, reflections, shadows, and load times,[114][116][127] as well as the addition of a custom radio station[116][127] and video replay mode,[128][129] though GameSpy's Tuttle felt the latter was pointless without the ability to save videos.[128] Some critics thought the controls had not been improved since the original,[118][121] and others considered it a downgrade,[128][129] though GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann appreciated the Xbox controller's analogue triggers when driving.[110] Some technical problems occasionally persisted, including pop-up, inconsistent frame rates, and poor aliasing,[110][121][129] and some reviewers bemoaned the lack of significant graphical improvements.[116][118]\n\nMobile version\n\nSan Andreas's mobile version received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to Metacritic.[80] TouchArcade's Eli Hodapp considered it \"the best the game has ever been\",[132] while Digital Spy's Scott Nichols said it was \"easily the worst way to experience\" the game, only recommending that players with newer mobile hardware consider purchasing.[133] Its US$6.99 price point was praised.[130][132][134][135]\nReviewers praised the port's graphical enhancements, including increased draw distance, improved frame rates and load times, and enhanced models, reflections, shadows, and lighting,[131][132][134][135] though IGN's Leif Johnson found the textures remained dated[130] and some critics encountered technical issues like pop-up.[135][136] Digital Spy's Nichols lauded the addition of mid-mission checkpoints,[133] and TouchArcade's Hodapp found cloud saves the port's best feature.[132] Responses to the controls were generally positive,[131][132][134] considered an improvement over the series' previous mobile ports,[135] though critics concurred that playing with a controller improved the experience and better imitated the original versions.[130][131][132]\n\nAccolades\nSan Andreas won four of its five nominations at the Spike Video Game Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Action Game, and Best Performance by a Human Male for Jackson as Tenpenny.[137] It received four nominations at the British Academy Games Awards[138] and five at the Game Developers Choice Awards;[139] according to The Guardian, the developers walked out during the latter after winning nothing.[140] It won five awards at the Golden Joystick Awards, including Ultimate Game of the Year and Hero and Villain for CJ and Tenpenny, respectively,[141] and received six nominations at the Interactive Achievement Awards, of which it won Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack and Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year.[142]\nSan Andreas was named 2004's best game by GamesMaster[143] and runner-up by PSM.[144] It won PlayStation 2 Game of the Year and Best Game Within a Game (for pool) from Electronic Gaming Monthly,[145] Best PlayStation 2 Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Voice Acting, and Funniest Game from GameSpot,[146][147][148][149] Best Action Game and Best Story for PlayStation 2 from IGN,[150][151] and Best Replay Value and Best Voice Acting from PSM.[144]\n\n\nSales\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas sold 4.5\u00a0million copies in its first week,[157] outselling Vice City by 45%.[158] In the United States, it sold 2.06\u00a0million units within six days of release[159] and generated US$235 million in revenue in its first week;[160] it sold 1.5\u00a0million units in November, totalling 3.6\u00a0million sales overall. Analysts noted the game, alongside Halo 2, led the industry to an 11% annual increase instead of a 21% decrease.[161] In the United Kingdom, it sold an estimated 677,000 copies and grossed about \u00a324 million within two days, setting the record for the most copies sold during a weekend,[162] and over 1\u00a0million copies and \u00a335 million in nine days, becoming the country's fast-selling game.[163] In Australia, it sold over 58,000 copies in its opening weekend, becoming the country's eleventh-best-selling game.[164]\nMichael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan estimated the game had earned a gross profit of around US$285 million within three months, and would generate US$400 million in worldwide sales by the year's end.[23] San Andreas was 2004's best-selling game, with 5.1\u00a0million copies sold in the United States[165] and over 1.75\u00a0million in the United Kingdom.[166] It was 2005's eighth-highest-grossing game in the United States.[167] The game topped the charts upon release in Japan, selling over 227,000 units in its first week.[168] It was the best-selling game in the United States by April 2008, with over 8.6\u00a0million units sold,[169] and the best-selling PlayStation 2 game with 17.33\u00a0million units sold by 2009.[50] Worldwide sales reached 12\u00a0million units by March 2005,[170] 21.5\u00a0million by April 2008,[169] and 27.5\u00a0million by 2011. It is among the best-selling games of all time.[171]\n\n\"Hot Coffee\" controversy\n\nThe development team curtailed planned nudity and sexual content to meet the requirements for a \"Mature\" rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB); rather than removing the content, they made it inaccessible to players. Modders discovered the code on the PlayStation 2 release, and modder Patrick Wildenborg found how to enable the code after the Windows release. He released this modified code online under the name \"Hot Coffee\" after the euphemism used in the game, and it was downloaded over one million times within four weeks.[172] \nThe discovery of  \"Hot Coffee\" resulted in legal backlash for Rockstar and Take-Two; both remained mostly silent on the matter.[25]:\u200a203\u2013208\u200a The ESRB re-rated the game \"Adults Only\" after an investigation,[173] while the game was banned in Australia until the explicit content was removed.[174] Rockstar and Take-Two received a warning from the Federal Trade Commission for failing to disclose the extent of graphic content present,[175] while a class action lawsuit alleged that the company had misled customers who believed the game's content fell along the lines of a \"Mature\" rating.[176][177] As a result of \"Hot Coffee\", the ESRB announced fines of up to US$1\u00a0million for game developers who failed to disclose the extent of their graphic content.[178]\n\nLegacy\nCritics agreed San Andreas was among the most significant titles in the sixth generation of console gaming[179] and among the best games ever made.[180] Rockstar established a new narrative continuity for the series with seventh-generation consoles, focusing more on realism and details. With Grand Theft Auto IV (2008), the team focused on increasing the amount and detail of buildings,[181] removing dead spots and irrelevant spaces to allow \"a more focused experience\" than San Andreas.[182][183] The focus on realism and depth was continued with Grand Theft Auto V, with the development team re-designing Los Santos and excluding San Fierro and Las Venturas; Dan Houser felt that by incorporating three cities into San Andreas, the development team was limited in how effectively they could emulate Los Angeles.[184][185] Garbut felt technical limitations prevented San Andreas from properly capturing Los Angeles, making it feel like a \"backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about\" and effectively deeming it as a jumping-off point for the development of Grand Theft Auto V.[186]\nSeveral moments from the game became common internet memes, such as Big Smoke's extensive fast food order in 2016[187][188][189] and one of CJ's first lines\u2014\"Ah shit, here we go again\"\u2014in April 2019.[190][191][192] An early mission, \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\", became notable for its difficulty; Big Smoke's dialogue upon failing the mission\u2014\"All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!\"\u2014was considered an iconic catchphrase[193][194][195] and later referenced in Grand Theft Auto V.[196] Modders have been known to frequently insert CJ into other games, such as Dark Souls (2011), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), and Street Fighter 6 (2023).[197][198][199]\n\nPorts\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas was released for Windows and the Xbox on 7 and 10\u00a0June 2005 in North America and Europe, respectively,[200] supporting higher screen resolutions, draw distance, and more detailed textures.[201] The Xbox version was released for the Xbox 360 on 20\u00a0October 2008 as part of Xbox Originals,[202] and the PlayStation 2 version for the PlayStation 3 on 11 December 2012 as part of PS2 Classics.[203] The Xbox Originals release was replaced with an enhanced version as part of the game's tenth anniversary on 26\u00a0October 2014, featuring higher resolution, enhanced draw distance, a new menu interface, and achievements;[204] the PS2 Classics release was replaced with this enhanced version on 1\u00a0December 2015,[205] and the PlayStation 2 version was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5\u00a0December.[206]\nSan Andreas was bundled with predecessors Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, released in North America for the Xbox on 8\u00a0October 2005,[74] PlayStation 2 on 4\u00a0December 2006,[207] and Mac OS X on 12\u00a0November 2010.[208] A remastered version of The Trilogy subtitled The Definitive Edition was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11\u00a0November 2021,[209] and for Android and iOS on 14 December 2023.[210] Existing versions of the game were removed from digital retailers in preparation for The Definitive Edition,[209] but later restored as a bundle on the Rockstar Store.[211]\nA mobile port of San Andreas, developed by War Drum Studios,[1] was released for iOS devices on 12\u00a0December 2013,[212] Android on 19\u00a0December,[213] Windows Phone on 27\u00a0January 2014,[214] and Fire OS on 15\u00a0May 2014.[215] The port featured updated graphics, shadows, and character and vehicle models.[130] In October 2021, Meta Platforms announced a virtual reality (VR) version of the game was in development for the Quest\u00a02[216] by Video Games Deluxe.[217] Following the release of the Meta Quest 3 in October 2023, players questioned the status of the VR version and some suspected it may have been quietly cancelled.[218][219] Meta said the port was \"on hold indefinitely\" in August 2024.[220]\n\nNotes\n\n^ Ported to iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Fire OS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 by War Drum Studios[1]\n\n^ CJ has more than 3,500 lines of dialogue in cutscenes, and over 4,200 in the open world.[49]\n\n\nReferences\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Leadbetter, Richard (31 October 2014). \"GTA: San Andreas HD on Xbox 360 is a mobile port\".

It is the fifth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh entry overall. Set within the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, the game follows Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, who returns home in 1992 after his mother's murder and finds his old street gang has lost much of their territory. Over the course of the game, he attempts to rebuild the gang, clashes with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals, and gradually unravels the truth behind his mother's murder.\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam San Andreas, consisting of three major metropolitan cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas, based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively. Rockstar conducted on-site research in each city and consulted Los Angeles natives DJ Pooh, Estevan Oriol, and Mister Cartoon for help imitating the city's culture. The narrative is based on multiple real-life events in Los Angeles, including the Bloods and Crips street gang rivalry, the 1990s crack epidemic, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and the Rampart scandal. The 50-person development team spent nearly two years creating the game. San Andreas was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2.\nThe game received critical acclaim for its characters, narrative, open world design, and visual fidelity, but mixed responses towards its mission design, technical issues, and portrayal of race. It generated controversy when the hidden \"Hot Coffee\" sex minigame was discovered, briefly requiring the game to be re-rated Adults Only. San Andreas received year-end accolades from several gaming publications, and it is considered one of the sixth generation of console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made. It was released for Windows and the Xbox in 2005, followed by enhanced versions and mobile ports in the 2010s, and a remastered version in 2021. San Andreas is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game with over 17.3\u00a0million copies sold, and one of the best-selling games of all time with 27.5\u00a0million copies sold overall. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released in April 2008.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game is played from a third-person view and its open world can be navigated using cars and other vehicles.[2][3]\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.[2] In the game, players control criminal Carl \"CJ\" Johnson and complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world and complete optional side missions.[4][5] A multiplayer mode allows two players to roam the world.[6] The fictional state of San Andreas, which makes up the open world, comprises three metropolitan cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas.[7] The cities are unlocked as the story progresses;[8] airports allow teleportation between each city using fast travel.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Scattered throughout the map, safehouses can be purchased to save the game and store vehicles.[9]:\u200a20\u200a\nPlayers may run, swim, and use vehicles to navigate the world,[3] and use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, including the ability to dual wield firearms and commit drive-by shootings.[10][11] Weapons are purchased from local firearms dealers, retrieved from dead enemies, and found scattered through the world.[12] In combat, auto-aim is used to lock on to targets.[9]:\u200a42\u200a Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through health pick-ups, and body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage.[10][13] Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes.[14]:\u200a100\u200a If players commit crimes, law enforcement may respond as indicated by a \"wanted\" meter in the head-up display. Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level; at the maximum six-star level, police helicopters and military are sent after players.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.[9]:\u200a29\u200a The game features more than 180 vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, aircraft, boats, and remote-control vehicles,[9]:\u200a6\u201311\u200a and most can be accessorised with modifications like hydraulics, nitrous oxide engines, and stereo systems.[9]:\u200a201\u2013204\u200a\n\nPlayers can fight members from enemy gangs to earn their territory.[9]:\u200a196\u200a\nIn the world, players can fight for territory by attacking rival gang members; the territory is won when players survive three waves of responding enemy attacks. Won territories are subject to periodic enemy gang attacks\u2014they must be successfully defended or else lost.[9]:\u200a196\u200a While free roaming the world, players may engage in activities such as burglary, fire fighting, pimping, taxi, and vigilante missions;[9]:\u200a176\u2013180\u200a completion rewards players with cash, which can be spent on CJ's accessories, clothing, hairstyles, and tattoos\u2014new role-playing elements for the series.[10][15] Balancing food and physical activity impacts CJ's appearance and physical attributes; eating and exercising maintains health, while losing muscle lessens combat effectiveness.[16] Three styles of hand-to-hand combat\u2014boxing, kickboxing, and mixed martial arts\u2014are taught at gyms in each city.[9]:\u200a144\u2013145\u200a[17]:\u200a31\u200a The game tracks respect among CJ's friends, which varies according to his actions and appearance.[9]:\u200a1\u200a Acquired skills are also tracked, such as driving, firearms handling, lung capacity, muscles, and stamina, which unlock additional game mechanics.[3][9]:\u200a4\u200a Players can date six different girls and take them to dinner, drinks, or dancing.[9]:\u200a200\u2013201\u200a\n\nPlot\nIn 1992, after five years in Liberty City, gangster Carl \"CJ\" Johnson (Young Maylay) returns to Los Santos following his mother's death in a drive-by shooting. He is intercepted by corrupt C.R.A.S.H. officers led by Frank Tenpenny (Samuel L. Jackson), who threaten to implicate CJ in the killing of a fellow police officer unless he co-operates with them. CJ returns to Grove Street and reunites with his brother Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson (Faizon Love), sister Kendl Johnson (Yolanda Whittaker), and members of his old gang, Big Smoke (Clifton Powell) and Ryder (MC Eiht). Discovering the Grove Street Families (GSF) have lost much of their territory, CJ restores the gang to power by helping reunite the various GSF sets who had splintered and allying himself with Cesar Vialpando (Clifton Collins Jr.)\u2014Kendl's boyfriend and leader of the Varrios Los Aztecas gang. CJ and Cesar witness Smoke and Ryder meeting with Tenpenny and the rival Ballas gang, and discover they betrayed the GSF and were responsible for killing CJ's mother. Suspecting a set-up, CJ rushes to Sweet's aid in a showdown against the Ballas.\nSweet gets wounded in the ambush and imprisoned, while Tenpenny exiles CJ to the countryside, where he forces him to eliminate witnesses to C.R.A.S.H.'s corruption in exchange for Sweet's safety in prison. CJ befriends an aging hippie and marijuana farmer named \"the Truth\" (Peter Fonda) and Triad leader Wu Zi Mu (James Yaegashi). He participates in a street race and wins a garage in San Fierro, which he sets up to earn money, and crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Big Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. Infiltrating the organisation, he identifies its leader: the affable but mysterious Mike Toreno (James Woods). Alongside Cesar and the Triad, CJ destroys the Loco Syndicate's drug factory and kills their leaders and Ryder. Toreno reveals himself to be an undercover government agent and enlists CJ's help in several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's release from prison. Meanwhile, CJ and Wu Zi Mu establish a casino in Las Venturas, where they clash against a rival, Mafia-run casino.\nAfter his release, Sweet and CJ revive the GSF, drive off the rival gangs from their territory, and rebuild throughout Los Santos. Tenpenny is arrested and tried for several felonies, but the charges are dropped due to lack of witnesses, prompting a city-wide riot. CJ soon discovers Big Smoke's hideout. The two engage in a gunfight; CJ wins, and before dying, Smoke confesses that he got caught up in power and money. Tenpenny arrives, holds CJ at gunpoint while he steals Smoke's drug money, and causes an explosion in the building to escape. He drives off in a fire truck, followed by CJ and Sweet, but eventually loses control of the vehicle and crashes over the side of a bridge overlooking Grove Street. CJ and his friends watch as Tenpenny dies of his injuries, ending the riot. In the aftermath, CJ's family and friends celebrate their success at the Johnson house. In the midst of the celebrations, CJ leaves to check on the neighbourhood.\n\nDevelopment\nLike the two previous Grand Theft Auto entries, Benzies produced San Andreas with Dan Houser, who also co-wrote the story. Sam Houser, president of Rockstar Games, was executive producer.[18]:\u200a20\u201321\u200a\nThe 50-person team at Rockstar North began development of San Andreas following the release of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in October 2002.[19][20] Having two years of development, as opposed to Vice City's one, gave them more opportunities to experiment and reevaluate the previous Grand Theft Auto games.[20] Producer Leslie Benzies hoped San Andreas would redefine the series and \"revolutionize open-ended gameplay and video game production values\".[21] Rockstar Games's The Warriors, originally scheduled to be released in 2004, was delayed to 2005 to provide additional resources to San Andreas.[22] San Andreas had a budget of under US$10 million.[23]\nRockstar North's minimal turnover since the development of the series's first game, Grand Theft Auto (1997), allowed the team to leverage their experience with the series.[24]:\u200a57\u200a Some developers were concerned about working conditions at Rockstar during San Andreas's development, as they were unable to take an adequate break after Vice City. Programmer Gary Foreman feared the company had entered a \"constant crunch\", as some developers worked for 17 hours per day.[25]:\u200a138\u200a Some stepped away after disagreements with Rockstar president Sam Houser about working conditions,[25]:\u200a139\u2013141,\u200a160\u200a and one veteran employee quit in objection to the portrayal of African Americans and what he perceived to be a gloomier and more exploitative tone in Rockstar's output, particularly San Andreas and Rockstar North's previous game, Manhunt (2003).[25]:\u200a167\u200a\n\nTechnical and open world design\n\n\nWe love L.A., and the whole gangbanging vibe, and the street culture. That time [early '90s] in L.A. is so important and we knew a long time ago that the franchise needed to end up there. We'd done the East Coast in GTA3, and then '80s Miami with Vice City, so going to L.A. in the early '90s just seemed like an obvious place for us to go.\n\n\n\n\nSan Andreas's world was originally envisioned as three separate maps connected by public transport; it later became three cities in one map, with countryside and desert in between.[19] Its cities are inspired by real locations: Los Santos by Los Angeles, San Fierro by San Francisco, and Las Venturas by Las Vegas.[7][27]:\u200a44\u200a Early in development, the team travelled to each city for research and photography;[28]:\u200a61\u200a[29]:\u200a40\u200a art director Aaron Garbut felt Los Angeles's gang territory in particular was difficult to capture without first-hand experience.[20] Rockstar's New York-based research team took thousands of photographs and video,[20][28]:\u200a61\u200a some of which were used as textures in the game.[19] San Andreas's world is 36 square kilometres (14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[30] about four to six times larger than Grand Theft Auto III's and Vice City's;[27]:\u200a44\u200a each city in San Andreas is approximately as large as Vice City.[31] Garbut found it more difficult to memorise San Andreas's larger map than its predecessors'.[28]:\u200a61\u200a The team wanted all elements\u2014including packaging and marketing\u2014to maintain a consistent theme to ensure players felt they were connected.[32][33]:\u200a47\u200a\nBenzies felt Rockstar North's relationship with Los Angeles natives Estevan Oriol, Mister Cartoon, and DJ Pooh helped them imitate the city's 1990s street culture.[29]:\u200a40\u200a The team wanted to ensure the world looked neither too \"toy-towny\" nor too precise,[32] as they sought \"depth\" over quantitative size; Garbut wanted players to \"feel like [they] can stop at any point and discover new things\".[20] Real-world areas were the inspiration for many in-game locations: Compton for Los Santos's urban areas, and the Golden Gate Bridge for the Gant Bridge.[34][35] The team were enthusiastic about the inclusion of mountains, forests, and a desert\u2014firsts for the series.[20][36] San Fierro's hills, based on those in San Francisco, were intended to draw the player's focus towards vehicle gameplay,[27]:\u200a45\u200a and the open countryside driving was inspired from a technical perspective by Rockstar's Smuggler's Run (2002).[37]:\u200a42\u200a Producer and co-writer Dan Houser felt the game's return to Los Santos in the final act afforded players a chance to view it from a different perspective.[38]:\u200a122\u200a Garbut established climate zones for each city represented by their sky colour: Los Santos's red-orange, San Fierro's blue, and Las Venturas's red.[19]\nSan Andreas was built using the game engine RenderWare.[39]:\u200a74\u200a Its render pipeline was rewritten for increased graphical detail and scope,[32] allowing 35\u201350% more polygons on screen,[39]:\u200a74\u200a real-time reflections and volumetric lighting, and unique models and lighting sets for day and night.[20][27]:\u200a45\u200a According to Garbut, the world is built with around 16,000 unique objects and buildings.[28]:\u200a61\u200a Several buildings share a single low-detail model,[30] allowing them to be loaded as players traverse the map without the interruption of loading screens like in Vice City.[38]:\u200a122\u200a Textures were created at a high resolution and scaled down for platforms unable to handle them.[30] The driving physics were reworked from previous games in consideration of San Andreas's more open areas.[32] Manhunt inspired San Andreas's stealth elements,[33]:\u200a49\u200a and the \"physicality\" of Manhunt's targeting and gun gameplay was adapted to the open world formula.[40] Computer scripting advancements enabled the developers to create gameplay features not possible in their previous games, such as the casino minigames.[30]\n\nStory and characters\nSeveral historical events influenced the narrative, including the Rampart scandal of the Los Angeles Police Department,[41] the 1990s crack epidemic, the 1992 Los Angeles riots,[42] and the rivalry between the Bloods and Crips street gangs.[43] Sam Houser recounted being fascinated by the appearances of street gangs and terrified by their behaviour;[44] the writers sought to accurately portray gang violence without glorifying it,[24]:\u200a54\u200a and wanted each gang to act differently, signified by unique walking styles.[19] DJ Pooh was hired to co-write the game from an American perspective.[25]:\u200a189\u200a The narrative was influenced by Hollywood films; Dan Houser said the team watched \"hundreds of movies to get the California vibe\".[36] The developers referenced Boyz n the Hood (1991), Colors (1988), and Menace II Society (1993) for narrative inspiration, and compared their in-game locations to those in different films: the countryside to Deliverance (1972), San Fierro to Bullitt (1968), and Las Venturas to Casino (1995).[39]:\u200a77\u200a Journalists identified references to other films like Juice (1992) and New Jack City (1991).[45][46][47][48] The focus on several communities was prompted by the variety in West Coast culture in the 1990s.[40]\nWhile the stories are largely unconnected, San Andreas concluded a trilogy that started with Grand Theft Auto III, allowing Rockstar to explore the 1980s (Vice City), 1990s (San Andreas), and early 2000s (III).[40] The team felt \"the world's attention was on California\" in the 1990s in regards to news and music, and that it translated well to the game.[39]:\u200a77\u200a Dan Houser said the game's satire was aimed towards the \"broader weirdness\" of American consumerism and action movies.[32] He noted the writers attempted to outdo each other's humour.[32] The team wanted to give players the freedom to make choices while maintaining interest in the story.[32] The game features over 400 speaking actors[32] and over 60,000 lines of dialogue, including over 7,700[b] for CJ;[49] it broke a Guinness World Record for the largest video game voice cast with 861 credited actors.[50] Each non-player character had around an hour of dialogue, in contrast to Vice City's ten minutes.[39]:\u200a71\u200a\nSam Houser sought an unknown actor for CJ, as he found Ray Liotta's performance as Tommy Vercetti in Vice City \"conflicting\" due to his familiarity with Liotta's previous work. He opted to cast celebrities in secondary roles, such as Jackson as Tenpenny, and he felt Young Maylay's obscurity in the industry made CJ feel \"very, very human\".[51] Rockstar asked Young Maylay to audition after overhearing him speak with DJ Pooh; he was cast in the role\u2014his first acting performance\u2014a few weeks after auditioning.[52]:\u200a41\u200a He felt the developers gave him the freedom to imbue CJ with his own personality.[53] They aimed for CJ to be their \"most human\" character, ensuring he had \"the most intense story around him\" to allow players to identify.[24]:\u200a54\u200a DJ Pooh compared CJ to Tupac Shakur in his fierce dedication to family but ability to become \"cold-blooded\" when necessary.[54]:\u200a49\u200a The team felt the ability to adjust CJ's weight helped players feel their actions could have consequences.[40] Dan Houser felt CJ's customisability allowed players to better connect with the characters.[27]:\u200a50\u200a DJ Pooh engaged several other actors to work on the game, such as Faizon Love, MC Eiht, and Shawn Fonteno.[19]\n\nMusic\n\nRockstar partnered with Interscope Records to create the soundtrack.[55] The in-game radio features eleven radio stations with twenty DJs\u2014including Axl Rose, Chuck D, and George Clinton[56]\u2014and more than three times as many licensed songs and original in-universe advertisements as Grand Theft Auto III. The radio features were overhauled; instead of looping sounds, each station became dynamic, allowing a randomised song order, accurate weather predictions, and story-relevant news announcements.[57] Michael Hunter wrote the game's main theme,[58] partly inspired by his childhood experiences with hip hop through Yo! MTV Raps (1988\u20131995).[19] Interscope published two albums for the game: a two-disc album in November 2004,[59] and an eight-disc box set in December.[60] Post-PlayStation 2 versions of the game added an additional radio station supporting a custom, user-imported soundtrack.[61]\n\n\nIn October 2003, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive announced the next Grand Theft Auto game would be released in 2004's third quarter,[62] and it prompted speculation after registering GTA: San Andreas with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2003.[63] Rockstar announced the game in March 2004, along with a scheduled release date of 19 and 22 October in North America and Europe, respectively.[21] The first details and screenshots were released at E3 in May[47] alongside a cover story in Game Informer,[64] followed by the cover art in July.[65] Rockstar launched the official website and first trailer in August,[66][67] followed by the second trailer in September.[68][69] In September, Take-Two announced the game's delay to 26 and 29\u00a0October in North America and Europe, respectively, and revealed it would be released for Windows in early 2005.[70] Rockstar commissioned hand-painted advertisements for San Andreas around the world in late 2004; one in Melbourne remained partially visible in 2020.[71]\nIn October 2004, an early version of the game was leaked by hackers;[72] Rockstar asserted it would \"aggressively pursue this matter\" and asked for information.[73] The game was released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004.[70] A special edition version was published for the PlayStation 2 on 8\u00a0October 2005, featuring Rockstar's debut documentary film Sunday Driver, about a lowrider car club in Compton.[74] It also included The Introduction,[75] an in-engine video previously provided on a DVD with the game's soundtrack.[59] The 21-minute video chronicles the events leading up to San Andreas, featuring CJ, Sweet, Big Smoke, Ryder, and Tenpenny.[76] GameSpot recommended the film for fans of the series;[77] IGN's Chris Carle enjoyed the voice acting but found the narrative uncompelling and felt the film alone was not worth purchasing the special edition.[75] Capcom published the game in Japan on 25\u00a0January 2007.[78][79]\n\nReception\nCritical response\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[80] It is the site's fifth-highest-rated PlayStation 2 game.[87] PSM2's Daniel Dawkins declared it \"the single most complete, unique, universe in console history\" after The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) and \"the best entertainment console gaming can offer\".[88] Game Informer's Andrew Reiner called it \"entertainment at its best\"[84] and GameSpy's Miguel Lopez wrote it reminded him why he plays games: \"to be liberated from the constraints of reality, and explore living, breathing worlds\".[89]\nSeveral reviewers considered San Andreas's world an improvement over its predecessors',[84][86][90] praising the attention to detail in its areas and characters;[10][91] IGN's Jeremy Dunham cited the differences in each city's weather as a highlight.[10] 1Up.com's Jeremy Parish considered it \"the most complete, complex and detailed environment ever crafted for a game\", praising the complexities of the freeway system and social dynamics.[90] GameSpy's Lopez lauded its accurate imitation of the American West Coast.[92] Critics considered the graphics an improvement over Vice City,[91][93] particularly regarding the animations, foliage, lighting, and weather effects;[3][10][83] PALGN's Chris Sell called it \"one of the most visually absorbing games ever\".[86] Criticism was directed at the game's technical issues, with several reviewers encountering pop-up,[10][86][88] and unstable frame rates;[3][90][91] some felt the game pushed the PlayStation 2 hardware to its limit.[90][91]\nGame Informer's Reiner considered gameplay a dramatic improvement over previous entries.[84] PSM2's Dawkins found the missions were rarely repetitive and blended difficulty with comedy.[94] GameRevolution's Joe Dodson lauded the freedom provided to players,[83] while 1Up.com's Parish felt the previous games' improvisation had been removed[95] and Electronic Gaming Monthly's Dan Hsu thought it could have benefited from branching paths.[81] The New York Times's Charles Herold found the game's structure diminished enjoyment of its missions, forcing players to drive long distances and replay extensive sequences upon failing,[96] a complaint echoed by others.[83][86][91] Some reviewers criticised the combat targeting (though acknowledged the usefulness of auto-aim)[10][86][91] and the flight, racing, RC car, and minigame controls.[86][91][97][95] The addition of role-playing elements was praised for its simplicity, subtlety, and effectiveness,[3][81][91][98] though 1Up.com's Parish denounced some missions' statistical prerequisites.[95]\n\n\nSeveral critics considered the narrative the series' best to date,[10][86] which Eurogamer's Kristan Reed attributed to its focus on dialogue and scene-setting, both in and out of cutscenes.[91] Game Informer's Matt Miller enjoyed the narrative's ridicule of modern culture.[84] Some reviewers compared the story to Hollywood films and similar popular culture;[84][99] PSM2's Dawkins felt the finale \"outstrips the collected work\" of filmmakers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson.[94] Critics praised the cast's performances, particularly that of Young Maylay, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, and David Cross.[3][84][97] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine's John Davison considered CJ \"possibly one of the most well-developed and believable videogame characters ever made\" due to his layered personality and realistic behaviour;[93] 1Up.com's Parish concurred but felt CJ's kind nature made his in-game actions less believable, a problem that may have been circumvented through a branching narrative.[99]\nSome critics and scholars criticised the game for perpetuating racial stereotypes.[100][101][102][103] Seeing Black's Esther Iverem condemned the series for \"validating ... an accepted caricature\" rather than teaching respect and tolerance.[103] Dean Chan felt the series' protagonist shift from Tommy (an Italian American) to CJ (an African American) without subverting archetypes made it \"complicit in the pathologization and fetishization of race\".[104]:\u200a25\u200a Paul Barrett found its disregard and decontextualisation of institutional racism's structures suggest \"that the problems that African Americans experience is due to individual failure\", reinforced by the concept that white players can simply experience \"black identity\".[105]:\u200a114\u200a A Games and Culture study found youth groups \"do not passively receive the games' images and content\": white players expressed concern about its racial stereotypes, while African American players used it \"as a framework to discuss institutional racism\".[106]:\u200a264,\u200a279\u200a Rachael Hutchinson considered San Andreas \"a critical reflection on racial conflict in America\" and found several criticisms were based on limited viewings instead of the whole story.[107]:\u200a174\u2013175\u200a Kotaku opined some in-game interactions could be portrayed as a lack of racism, such as characters conversing without moderating vocabularies or commenting on others'.[108] 1Up.com's Parish lauded the references to Rodney King's assault and the sophisticated writing addressing race in South Central Los Angeles.[99] David J. Leonard felt politicians and legislators were more concerned about the game's violent and sexual content than its racial stereotypes.[102]:\u200a268\u200a\n\nWindows and Xbox versions\n\nSan Andreas's June 2005 release for Windows and Xbox received \"universal acclaim\" according to Metacritic.[80] It was the second-highest-rated Windows game of 2005, behind Civilization IV,[119] and the third-highest-rated Xbox game, behind Ninja Gaiden Black and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.[120]\nPALGN's Matt Keller considered the Windows release the best version of the game.[117] Reviewers lauded the improved graphics,[117][121] particularly the detailed textures and models, higher draw distance, and improved frame rate, loading times, and anti-aliasing,[109][117][122][123] though some considered the graphics outdated for the platform.[115][124] PALGN's Keller found the increased population density improved the world's overall atmosphere.[117] The mouse and keyboard controls were generally praised as an improvement over the console versions and the series' previous Windows ports,[117][123][125] especially during combat gameplay,[11][115][117][126] though responses to driving controls and keyboard mapping were mixed.[109][115][121] Praise was directed at the custom radio[109][125] and physical packaging and manual.[11][126] Some critics bemoaned the lack of changes to the mission structure,[122][123] and some encountered technical difficulties like sudden and major lagging spikes.[113][126]\nGameZone's Eduardo Zacarias called the Xbox release the \"definitive version of the game\",[114] and GameSpy's Will Tuttle considered it better than the original.[127] Several reviewers praised the improved assets, reflections, shadows, and load times,[114][116][127] as well as the addition of a custom radio station[116][127] and video replay mode,[128][129] though GameSpy's Tuttle felt the latter was pointless without the ability to save videos.[128] Some critics thought the controls had not been improved since the original,[118][121] and others considered it a downgrade,[128][129] though GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann appreciated the Xbox controller's analogue triggers when driving.[110] Some technical problems occasionally persisted, including pop-up, inconsistent frame rates, and poor aliasing,[110][121][129] and some reviewers bemoaned the lack of significant graphical improvements.[116][118]\n\nMobile version\n\nSan Andreas's mobile version received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to Metacritic.[80] TouchArcade's Eli Hodapp considered it \"the best the game has ever been\",[132] while Digital Spy's Scott Nichols said it was \"easily the worst way to experience\" the game, only recommending that players with newer mobile hardware consider purchasing.[133] Its US$6.99 price point was praised.[130][132][134][135]\nReviewers praised the port's graphical enhancements, including increased draw distance, improved frame rates and load times, and enhanced models, reflections, shadows, and lighting,[131][132][134][135] though IGN's Leif Johnson found the textures remained dated[130] and some critics encountered technical issues like pop-up.[135][136] Digital Spy's Nichols lauded the addition of mid-mission checkpoints,[133] and TouchArcade's Hodapp found cloud saves the port's best feature.[132] Responses to the controls were generally positive,[131][132][134] considered an improvement over the series' previous mobile ports,[135] though critics concurred that playing with a controller improved the experience and better imitated the original versions.[130][131][132]\n\nAccolades\nSan Andreas won four of its five nominations at the Spike Video Game Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Action Game, and Best Performance by a Human Male for Jackson as Tenpenny.[137] It received four nominations at the British Academy Games Awards[138] and five at the Game Developers Choice Awards;[139] according to The Guardian, the developers walked out during the latter after winning nothing.[140] It won five awards at the Golden Joystick Awards, including Ultimate Game of the Year and Hero and Villain for CJ and Tenpenny, respectively,[141] and received six nominations at the Interactive Achievement Awards, of which it won Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack and Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year.[142]\nSan Andreas was named 2004's best game by GamesMaster[143] and runner-up by PSM.[144] It won PlayStation 2 Game of the Year and Best Game Within a Game (for pool) from Electronic Gaming Monthly,[145] Best PlayStation 2 Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Voice Acting, and Funniest Game from GameSpot,[146][147][148][149] Best Action Game and Best Story for PlayStation 2 from IGN,[150][151] and Best Replay Value and Best Voice Acting from PSM.[144]\n\n\nSales\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas sold 4.5\u00a0million copies in its first week,[157] outselling Vice City by 45%.[158] In the United States, it sold 2.06\u00a0million units within six days of release[159] and generated US$235 million in revenue in its first week;[160] it sold 1.5\u00a0million units in November, totalling 3.6\u00a0million sales overall. Analysts noted the game, alongside Halo 2, led the industry to an 11% annual increase instead of a 21% decrease.[161] In the United Kingdom, it sold an estimated 677,000 copies and grossed about \u00a324 million within two days, setting the record for the most copies sold during a weekend,[162] and over 1\u00a0million copies and \u00a335 million in nine days, becoming the country's fast-selling game.[163] In Australia, it sold over 58,000 copies in its opening weekend, becoming the country's eleventh-best-selling game.[164]\nMichael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan estimated the game had earned a gross profit of around US$285 million within three months, and would generate US$400 million in worldwide sales by the year's end.[23] San Andreas was 2004's best-selling game, with 5.1\u00a0million copies sold in the United States[165] and over 1.75\u00a0million in the United Kingdom.[166] It was 2005's eighth-highest-grossing game in the United States.[167] The game topped the charts upon release in Japan, selling over 227,000 units in its first week.[168] It was the best-selling game in the United States by April 2008, with over 8.6\u00a0million units sold,[169] and the best-selling PlayStation 2 game with 17.33\u00a0million units sold by 2009.[50] Worldwide sales reached 12\u00a0million units by March 2005,[170] 21.5\u00a0million by April 2008,[169] and 27.5\u00a0million by 2011. It is among the best-selling games of all time.[171]\n\n\"Hot Coffee\" controversy\n\nThe development team curtailed planned nudity and sexual content to meet the requirements for a \"Mature\" rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB); rather than removing the content, they made it inaccessible to players. Modders discovered the code on the PlayStation 2 release, and modder Patrick Wildenborg found how to enable the code after the Windows release. He released this modified code online under the name \"Hot Coffee\" after the euphemism used in the game, and it was downloaded over one million times within four weeks.[172] \nThe discovery of  \"Hot Coffee\" resulted in legal backlash for Rockstar and Take-Two; both remained mostly silent on the matter.[25]:\u200a203\u2013208\u200a The ESRB re-rated the game \"Adults Only\" after an investigation,[173] while the game was banned in Australia until the explicit content was removed.[174] Rockstar and Take-Two received a warning from the Federal Trade Commission for failing to disclose the extent of graphic content present,[175] while a class action lawsuit alleged that the company had misled customers who believed the game's content fell along the lines of a \"Mature\" rating.[176][177] As a result of \"Hot Coffee\", the ESRB announced fines of up to US$1\u00a0million for game developers who failed to disclose the extent of their graphic content.[178]\n\nLegacy\nCritics agreed San Andreas was among the most significant titles in the sixth generation of console gaming[179] and among the best games ever made.[180] Rockstar established a new narrative continuity for the series with seventh-generation consoles, focusing more on realism and details. With Grand Theft Auto IV (2008), the team focused on increasing the amount and detail of buildings,[181] removing dead spots and irrelevant spaces to allow \"a more focused experience\" than San Andreas.[182][183] The focus on realism and depth was continued with Grand Theft Auto V, with the development team re-designing Los Santos and excluding San Fierro and Las Venturas; Dan Houser felt that by incorporating three cities into San Andreas, the development team was limited in how effectively they could emulate Los Angeles.[184][185] Garbut felt technical limitations prevented San Andreas from properly capturing Los Angeles, making it feel like a \"backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about\" and effectively deeming it as a jumping-off point for the development of Grand Theft Auto V.[186]\nSeveral moments from the game became common internet memes, such as Big Smoke's extensive fast food order in 2016[187][188][189] and one of CJ's first lines\u2014\"Ah shit, here we go again\"\u2014in April 2019.[190][191][192] An early mission, \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\", became notable for its difficulty; Big Smoke's dialogue upon failing the mission\u2014\"All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!\"\u2014was considered an iconic catchphrase[193][194][195] and later referenced in Grand Theft Auto V.[196] Modders have been known to frequently insert CJ into other games, such as Dark Souls (2011), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), and Street Fighter 6 (2023).[197][198][199]\n\nPorts\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas was released for Windows and the Xbox on 7 and 10\u00a0June 2005 in North America and Europe, respectively,[200] supporting higher screen resolutions, draw distance, and more detailed textures.[201] The Xbox version was released for the Xbox 360 on 20\u00a0October 2008 as part of Xbox Originals,[202] and the PlayStation 2 version for the PlayStation 3 on 11 December 2012 as part of PS2 Classics.[203] The Xbox Originals release was replaced with an enhanced version as part of the game's tenth anniversary on 26\u00a0October 2014, featuring higher resolution, enhanced draw distance, a new menu interface, and achievements;[204] the PS2 Classics release was replaced with this enhanced version on 1\u00a0December 2015,[205] and the PlayStation 2 version was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5\u00a0December.[206]\nSan Andreas was bundled with predecessors Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, released in North America for the Xbox on 8\u00a0October 2005,[74] PlayStation 2 on 4\u00a0December 2006,[207] and Mac OS X on 12\u00a0November 2010.[208] A remastered version of The Trilogy subtitled The Definitive Edition was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11\u00a0November 2021,[209] and for Android and iOS on 14 December 2023.[210] Existing versions of the game were removed from digital retailers in preparation for The Definitive Edition,[209] but later restored as a bundle on the Rockstar Store.[211]\nA mobile port of San Andreas, developed by War Drum Studios,[1] was released for iOS devices on 12\u00a0December 2013,[212] Android on 19\u00a0December,[213] Windows Phone on 27\u00a0January 2014,[214] and Fire OS on 15\u00a0May 2014.[215] The port featured updated graphics, shadows, and character and vehicle models.[130] In October 2021, Meta Platforms announced a virtual reality (VR) version of the game was in development for the Quest\u00a02[216] by Video Games Deluxe.[217] Following the release of the Meta Quest 3 in October 2023, players questioned the status of the VR version and some suspected it may have been quietly cancelled.[218][219] Meta said the port was \"on hold indefinitely\" in August 2024.[220]\n\nNotes\n\n^ Ported to iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Fire OS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 by War Drum Studios[1]\n\n^ CJ has more than 3,500 lines of dialogue in cutscenes, and over 4,200 in the open world.[49]\n\n\nReferences\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Leadbetter, Richard (31 October 2014). \"GTA: San Andreas HD on Xbox 360 is a mobile port\".
